      <h1>I turn Azure complexity into competitive advantage.</h1>
      <p>
        After 10 years doing this work, I've learned that good cloud infrastructure isn't about using every fancy
        feature available.
        It's about choosing what makes sense for your business and setting it up right from the start, so security is
        built in from day one,
        costs stay predictable, repetitive tasks disappear through automation, and your Microsoft 365 tools work
        together smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I build everything with a strong focus on Infrastructure-as-Code, which means your environment is properly
        documented and reproducible.
        No black boxes. No "only one person knows how this works", learned from my past situations. Your team can
        understand and manage what's been built.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will help you avoid messy configurations that pile up over time, compliance issues that could've been
        prevented, and security gaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, you get a clean, organized Azure setup that makes sense, delivers value right away, and grows with your
        business without the headaches.
