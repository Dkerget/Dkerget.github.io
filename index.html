      <h1>Cloud Network Engineer & Infrastructure Specialist delivering secure, scalable Azure solutions.</h1>
      <p>
        I build Azure environments that are clean, resilient, reliable, and easy to understand. 
        My focus is on secure cloud architecture that work consistently and scale with you, whether
        you are adopting Copilot, Fabric, or the next wave of Microsoft technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        My IT journey began in 2007 as a network administrator. Working in budget tight environments
        meant wearing many hats and keeping systems secure without room for mistakes. 
        I learned the hard way to become the person who understood every part of the infrastructure 
        and made sure it was secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, one principle became clear: strong cloud infrastructure isn’t about enabling every feature.
        It’s about selecting what fits the business, building it correctly from day one, and ensuring security,
        cost control, automation, and Microsoft 365 integration all work seamlessly together.
      </p>
      <p>
        I help organizations avoid the chaos of messy configurations, compliance gaps, and hidden security issues.
        Today, I’m focused on mastering practical AI adoption, secure implementation patterns, and the technologies
        emerging behind agentic AI, General AI, and quantum computing.
      </p>
        My goal is simple: make your cloud an advantage that others wish they had.
